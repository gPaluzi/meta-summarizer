# Meta-summarizer

A workflow to summarize camera trap data from metadata.

This mini-project is inspired by fast-paced cameratrap survey. We often have to manage many cameratraps, and i was curious about how those camera traps perform overtime.

**Note:**

The `data` folder should be following this format.
Containing station id and camera id. This example showing each station has pair camera trap.

<pre>
data/
├─ # Station ID
│ └── # Camera ID
│ └── # Camera ID
</pre>

Make sure that you already installed the `ffmpeg` binary file.
